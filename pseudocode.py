#this script finds all great white shark species in a phylogeny and prunes the tree 
#then downlaods occurrence data from obis and put onto a map

# greatwhiteshark = species that I want
# sharktree = shark phylogeny tree in newick format

# def treePrune (greatwhiteshark, sharktree):
    #return prunedtree = pruned version of shark tree with great white sharks only

#once I get the subtree

# script to feed the occurance data of the GWS from obis

# plot the data points using matplotlib
#diff color for each species

# calc and plot speciation rates
